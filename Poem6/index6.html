<h3 class="centered">
There’s a random<br/>
Painted highway<br/>
And a muzzle of bees<br/>
My sleeves have come unstitched<br/>
From climbing your tree<br/>
<br/>
The sun gets passed grin tree to tree<br/>
Silently and back to me<br/>
A breeze blown through<br/>
Pushed up above the sea<br/>
Finally next to you<br/>
<br/>
When the dog’s bark get look like they’re smiling<br/>
I don’t think they’re mean<br/>
Some people get frightened<br/>
Despite fences in between<br/>
And the green gets passed…<br/>
<br/>
To you as you begin to cry<br/>
I said maybe if I leave<br/>
You’ll want me to come back home<br/>
Or maybe all you mean<br/>
Is to sting a silence in me<br/>
<br/>
You’re irresistable when you get mad<br/>
Isn’t it sad I’m immune<br/>
And I thought it was cute<br/>
For you to kiss my purple black eye<br/>
Even though I caught it from you<br/>
<br/>
I still think we’re serious<br/>
