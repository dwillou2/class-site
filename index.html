        I, Dustin Willoughby, decided to take a course at Parsons titled Web Design Basics. It is Fall of 2017 and the class is led by Sasha Portis. A few of the projects include Do What? which is where we were instructed to write a program using the English language which produces a composition via a set of instructions, or Republish A Text where we were to experiment with publishing or processing a text online without typing a single line of code. You can’t forget about 20 Variations or the Event Microsite. Or the Screenshot Photography project. There were also some bi-weekly exercises here and there, like Malevich’s Boxes: Part One, Part Two, and Part Three; or Hover States where we were to investigate the desktop interface, specifically through its unique interaction of the hover state. Good times. Ah yeah, we also had to complete an exercise on Responsive Design and create a website that changes its form and/or content at the breakpoints of 320px, 480px, 600px, 768px, and 1024px. Abstract Grid was based around Flexbox. And lastly, the Sentence Generator.
