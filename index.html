        I, Dustin Willoughby, decided to take a course at Parsons titled Web Design Basics. It is Fall of 2017 and the class is led by Sasha Portis. A few of the projects include <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_DoWhat/index.html">Do What?</a> which is where we were instructed to write a program using the English language which produces a composition via a set of instructions, or <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_RepublishText/index.html">Republish A Text</a> where we were to experiment with publishing or processing a text online without typing a single line of code. You can’t forget about <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_20Variations/index.html">20 Variations</a> or the <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_EventMicrosite/index.html">Event Microsite</a>. Or the <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_Screenshot/index.html">Screenshot Photography</a> project. There were also some bi-weekly exercises here and there, like <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_Malevich/index.html">Malevich’s Boxes</a>, or <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_HoverStates/index.html">Hover States</a> where we were to investigate the desktop interface, specifically through its unique interaction of the hover state. Good times. Ah yeah, we also had to complete an exercise on <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_Responsive/index.html">Responsive Design</a> and create a website that changes its form and/or content at the breakpoints of 320px, 480px, 600px, 768px, and 1024px. <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_AbstractGrid/index.html">Abstract Grid</a> was based around Flexbox. And lastly, the <a href="https://dwillou2.github.io/class-site/Interior_SentenceGenerator/index.html">Sentence Generator</a>.
